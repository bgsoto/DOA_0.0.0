  noteText: Surveyor Camryn proposed a detour to Altair-III, and surprisingly, the
    captain agreed! I wanted to review the data from our last expedition to see what
    we had on Altair-III, but Miles keeps any research data locked in that desk drawer
    of his. I have no clue how to open it, but I bet that weird solar system model
    has something to do with it. I know that Miles likes to use <b>
  noteText2: ' </b>birthday as his password... but how does that correspond to those
    planets? Maybe I should check the crew log to remind myself what that birthday
    was again...'

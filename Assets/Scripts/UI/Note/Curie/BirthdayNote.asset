  noteTitle: Incident Report - Miles Behaving Strange
  isObjective2: 1
  noteText: A strange report came in today. Miles Cramer, Head of Research, was seen
    doodling something odd on his whiteboard. It looked like a solar system similar
    to the one he had in his office, but instead of planets, he had labeled each
    one with a number. If the report is to be believed, the numbers went from 9 to
    1, decending from Neptune to the Sun.

  noteText: 'Around the ship, you might come across similar terminals or computers
    displaying notes. These are often mission critical. Interacting with them will
    allow your tablet to record down any relevant information (unless there is none),
    and guide you on your next objective. Since this is your first mission in a while,
    I''ll give you a hint to get you started. The artifact is kept in that large
    safe just through these doors... but one question remains. How will you get it
    open?

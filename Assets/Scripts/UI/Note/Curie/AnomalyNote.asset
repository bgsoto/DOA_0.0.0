  noteText: "\tWe have taken the specimen from our recent expedition to \u201Cinsert
    room\u201D for further experimentation. Our resident biologist, Miss Eveheart,
    has noted that the specimen responds negatively to specific frequencies\u2026
    several of which correspond to the coordinates of known dimensional rifts. \r\n\tThe
    most prominent reaction is that of \u201Cinsert coordinate\u201D, the coordinates
    of a rift not too far from our next destination. I have asked Captain Holcomb
    to adjust our flight path accordingly, so that we may observe the specimen\u2019s
    reaction to the rift.\r"

  intelText: "[This is an exact copy of the message we left on Altair-III, just in
    case we need to file a formal report later.]\r\n\tCamryn, if you\u2019re reading
    this, we had to depart from the planet. After your signal went dark, some strange
    stuff happened with our bio scanners. A strange reading approached our ship,
    but suddenly vanished into thin air. The next day, we found a weird\u2026 thing
    in the cargo hold. Miles insists on calling it an \u201Cartifact\u201D, and has
    taken quite a liking to it. He keeps running experiments, and honestly the whole
    thing freaks me out. Look, I don\u2019t know what happened to you, but if you
    found your way to this beacon, just activate your emergency beacon and we\u2019ll
    send a ship for you. We can\u2019t stay any longer, our expedition is already
    running behind as it is. I\u2019m sorry to do this to you, but we really have
    no other choice but to leave now.\r"

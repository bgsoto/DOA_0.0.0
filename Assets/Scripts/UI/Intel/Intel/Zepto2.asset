  intelTitle: 'History of Zepto-I: Volume 2'
  intelText: "\tOne consequence of the Tech Race was the automation of labor within
    many industries. In the pursuit of efficiency, almost every job was soon relegated
    to the realm of automation. Many laborers across practically every field found
    themselves without a career, and lacking the means to financially support themselves.
    Due to the lack of demand for workers, the Council decided to pass a Universal
    Income bill to provide every citizen financially with the bare minimum they required
    to live.\r\n\tSeveral historical theorists predicted a major boom in the cultural
    arts during this period, and though they were correct, something else happened
    that they had not anticipated. Many workers simply did not have the aptitude
    for creative works, and had found fulfillment in their menial labor jobs. Other
    workers had their lives' passions pulled from under them, their dreams being
    taken by metallic unfeeling machines. \r\nThese workers banded together, forming
    a collective known as the Space  Trade Union. After several riots and clashes
    in the streets, the Council granted them several spaceships and allowed the STU
    to leave Zepto-I. The STU then founded a large colony on a distant planet, and
    outlawed the use of automatons. Despite their lower efficiency and productivity,
    the STU\u2019s home colony Theos insists on maintaining their traditional way
    of life.\r"

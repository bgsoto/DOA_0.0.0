  intelTitle: Datastreams and You
  intelText: "\tDatastreams! The new age of media is here! With nothing but your
    mind and your trusty S.C. tablet, you can write your thoughts straight into a
    packet of data to be recorded for safekeeping! An intelligent algorithm will
    ensure the record is intelligible, and will automatically translate it to any
    language the reader desires! Each Datastream is kept on a small chip which can
    be easily hooked into any official S.C. terminal, allowing for the easy reading
    and writing of information straight from your mind!\r"

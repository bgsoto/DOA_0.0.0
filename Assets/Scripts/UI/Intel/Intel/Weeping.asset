  intelText: "\tThe captain cries. Tears of sorrow. The departed weep. Echoes of
    death and destruction through the halls. I see it. I see it. The woman, the surveyor.
    To her death. I, the shepard. Cannot avoid it, cannot prevent it. I see it. In
    my dreams. Every night, like the last. Every night. Every closed-eye. Every drift-away.
    She leaves. She finds it. She becomes death. I weep. We weep. Poor soul. What
    else can we do? Footsteps approaching. Again and again. Every night. I wake in
    death. I see it again. Any day now, the cave, the dream, the weeping. The weeping.\r"

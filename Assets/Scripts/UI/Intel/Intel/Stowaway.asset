  intelText: "\tThere\u2019s a stowaway on this ship. I found him in the cargo hold,
    hiding inside one of our empty crates. He seems harmless, maybe even a little
    scared. I think he might have lost his mind, because he tends to ramble on about
    things that don\u2019t make sense. He keeps apologizing to me too, and honestly,
    I\u2019m starting to feel a little bad for him. After a little while of chatting,
    I think I figured out that he lives on Altair-III. That planet is actually right
    next to our destination\u2026 maybe I can try to convince the captain to make
    a pitstop there? If I\u2019m able to, I could also try and help the stowaway
    get back to where he lives.\r"

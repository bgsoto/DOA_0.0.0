  intelTitle: The Significance of Sol
  intelText: "\tOften, I find myself peering out through the window during my space
    travels. Staring into the great dark nothingness, the ever-present abyss. Often,
    I feel this longing, this calling, within my heart. In those darkest and loneliest
    of moments, I wish I were traversing through the Sol System. Passing by the chilling
    white-cold of Earth, or the mighty blue waves of Neptune. Crossing through that
    great abyss, with those perfect planets passing me by in that empty yet beautiful
    star system. Something within wishes I could be there, even now. My first ever
    star system discovery. The greatest achievement of my career."

  intelTitle: 'History of Zepto-I: Volume 1'
  intelText: "Zepto-I, commonly referred to as Homeworld by colonists and space-farers,
    is the birthplace of humanity. Unfortunately, the early history of humans has
    been lost to time due to negligent maintenance of physical records. What we do
    know of our history indicates a difficult and fraught uphill struggle, where
    death and depression were commonplace occurrences. \r\nAfter the technological
    boom of the early 2000\u2019s (commonly referred to as the Tech Race), the rates
    of death and depression began a steady decline, and the average lifespan of a
    human increased exponentially. This had the unintended impact of overcrowding
    the population of Zepto-I, and as a response, humanity turned to the stars. After
    a few failed attempts our first successful space-farers took to the stars, blazing
    a trail for the rest of humanity to follow suit. \r\nThese space-farers, Captain
    Terra Onett and her steadfast crew, founded the first extraterrestrial human
    outpost on Klein-III. This outpost, New Dawnstead, soon grew to be the largest
    human colony off-planet. In the years that followed, many space-farers followed
    in Onett\u2019s footsteps, and humanity gradually spread throughout the stars.\r"

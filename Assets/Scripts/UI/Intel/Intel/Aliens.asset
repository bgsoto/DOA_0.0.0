  intelTitle: Where are the Aliens?
  intelText: "[This stream has been poorly maintained, and only a small portion remains
    legible.]\r\n\t\u2026 and so I ask once more, in this society of planet-hopping
    space faring extraterrestrial colonists, where ARE our sentient neighbors? I
    don\u2019t mean those stupid exo-plants or any of the numerous \u201Clifeforms\u201D
    that have been discovered on planets far beyond, no! I mean walking, talking,
    thinking aliens! The real deal! How come in all our travels, not a SINGLE expedition
    has come across truly sentient life? If I were a rich man, and I\u2019m NOT,
    I would send out hundreds of ships! Thousands! Send them searching through every
    galaxy, scanning every planet! Investigating every strange occurrence! There
    has to be some other sentient being out there somewhere\u2026 right?\r"

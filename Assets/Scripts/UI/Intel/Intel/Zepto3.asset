  intelTitle: 'History of Zepto-I: Volume 3 '
  intelText: "\tOn and off Zepto-I, several factions have emerged as major players
    in the operation of galactic travel. Although each faction has their own perspectives
    on how things ought to be done, through a recent treaty the 3 have reached an
    uneasy peace. In these uncertain and unprecedented times, understanding the basics
    of each faction and their relation to Zepto-I is a must for prospective space
    travelers.\r\n\tOur first and largest faction is the Space Collective, known
    colloquially as the \u201CS.C.\u201D The S.C. was formed from the remnants of
    the old government in the aftermath of the Tech Race. The S.C. is often looked
    to as the de-facto governmental institution throughout most of the galaxy, although
    the other two factions do technically have full autonomy over their sector of
    the known star-systems. The S.C. is run by a large board of administrators, of
    which many of Zepto-I\u2019s wealthiest citizenry belong to.\r\n\tThe second
    largest faction, the Theorem League, also technically resides on Zepto-I. Although
    their base is on a space station orbiting Zepto-I, they technically remain within
    the planet\u2019s boundaries. The Theorem League is a collective of intellectual
    minds, most of whom hail from some of the top schools on Zepto-I. After the Tech
    Race and the establishment of the S.C. several intellectuals disagreed with the
    direction of their new leadership, and as such, launched into orbit and established
    their own governmental institution. Due to the exceedingly powerful technology
    used for their station, the Theorem League more or less forced the S.C. to permit
    their secession.\r\n\tThe final major faction, the Space Trade Union, is comprised
    of workers that opposed the intense automation brought on by the Tech Race. After
    the creation of the Theorem League, the STU followed suit and rioted against
    their perceived unjust government. The S.C. not wanting a massacre on their hands,
    ultimately caved and allowed the STU to depart from Zepto-I to form their own
    minor government. Although this faction is small, they somehow manage to have
    trade operations running in nearly every occupied star-system.\r"
